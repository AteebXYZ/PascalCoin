## Summary

This PIP proposes a backwards compatible addressing scheme to facilitate Layer-2 addresses as well as improve current Layer-1 payments and general usage.

## Motivation

PascalCoin current allows users to send/receive operations between accounts using their account numbers (PASA) as a reference. These account numbers are typically post-fixed with a checksum to avoid data entry errors. 

This proposal extends this specification to allow the embedding of a payload to an address. This allows a recipient to specify the payload the sender must enter when sending an operation. This is useful in many current use-cases such as a merchant specifying the payload code in the buyers transaction so that he can recognize it. Also, for exchanges to specify the payload for users to deposit. By using these addresses, a single PASA can be represented in many forms. 

Most importantly, Layer-2 applications require this as an addressing scheme for Layer-2 applications. As a result, this PIP proposes a formal specification for these addresses.

## Specification

Layer-2 addresses will be herein referred to as Extended PASA, or E-PASA for short.

### Extended PASA format (E-PASA)

An Extended PASA is defined by the below EBNF grammar:

    EPASA              = PASA, [ ExtendedAddress ] ;
    PASA               = Integer, "-", Checksum ;
    Checksum           = Digit, Digit ;
    ExtendedAddress    = ( PublicPayload | ReceiverEncPayload | SenderEncPayload | PasswordEncPayload ), [ ":", PayloadChecksum ] ;
    PublicPayload      = "[", Payload, "]" ;
    ReceiverEncPayload = "(", Payload, ")" ;
    SenderEncPayload   = "<", Payload, ">" ;
    PasswordEncPayload = "{", Payload, ":", Password, "}" ;
    Payload            = [ """, SafeAnsiString, """ | HexString | Base58String ] ;      (* allows empty payload *)
    PayloadChecksum    = HexDigit, HexDigit, HexDigit, HexDigit
    Password           = SafeAnsiString
    SafeAnsiString     = Pascal64StartChar, { Pascal64Char } ;
    SafeAnsiChar       = (" " | "!" | EscapeChar """ | "#" | "$" | "%" | "&" | "'" | "(" | ")" | "*" | "+" | "," | "-" | "." | "/" | "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" | ":" | ";" | "<" | "=" | ">" | "?" | "@" | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" | "I" | "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T" | "U" | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z" | "[" | EscapeChar "\" | "]" | "^" | "_" | "`" | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i" | "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z" | "{" | "|" | EscapeChar "}" | "~") ;
    HexString          = "0", "x", HexByte { HexByte } ;
    HexByte            = HexDigit, HexDigit
    HexDigit           = ( Digit | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" ) ;       (* no uppercase hex allowed *)
    Base58String       = Base58Char, { Base58Char } ;
    Base58Char         = ( NaturalDigit | Base58UpperChar | Base58LowerChar ) ; 
    Base58UpperChar    = ( "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N", "P", "Q", "R", "S", "T", "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y", "Z" ) ;     (* missing I, O *)
    Base58LowerChar    = ( "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z" ) ; (* missing l *)
    Digit              = ( "0" | NaturalDigit ) ;
    NaturalDigit       = ( "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ) ;
    EscapeChar         = "\"

#### Validation Rules

#### PASA Checksum

TODO: add existing PASA checksum rule

#### Payload Checksum

In order to avoid data entry errors, the payload portion is **optionally** checksummed. The payload checksum is calculated as follows:

```
    PayloadChecksum = ToHexStringLE ( CastToUINT16( MurMur3( ToAsciiBytes ( PayloadEncType ++ Payload ) ) MOD 65536 ) )

    where
       PayloadEncType  = "0" for PublicPayload
                       = "1" for ReceiverEncPayload
                       = "2" for SenderEncPayload
                       = "3" for PasswordEncPayload
       ToAsciiBytes    = converts ASCII string argument into raw byte form, character by character (no endianness concerns here)                
       MurMur3         = performs 32bit MurMur3 hash of the byte array argument                
       CastToUINT16    = casts the integer argument into to a 16bit unsigned integer (should never overflow due to modulo 65536)
       ToHexStringLE   = converts the 16bit unsigned integer argument into 4 hexadecimal characters in little-endian
```

#### Payload Lengths

The following validation rules must be applied to Payload lends

- For public unecrypted ASCII payloads the string length must be less than or equal to 255 
- For ECIES encrypted ASCII payloads the string length must be less than or equal to ???
- For AES encrypted ASCII payloads the string length must be less than or equal to ???
- For public unecrypted Hexadecimal or Base58 payloads the string length must be less than or equal to 510
- For ECIES encrypted Hexadecimal or Base58 payloads the string length must be less than or equal to ???
- For AES encrypted Hexadecimal or Base58 payloads the string length must be less than or equal to ???

TODO: add escaped password examples

TODO: add Base58 examples

## Rationale

The design approach was to remain backwards compatible in order to allow existing JSON API's to simply accept E-PASA addresses and which automatically fill out the payload fields.

## Backwards Compatibility

This PIP is backwards compatible and does not require a hard-fork activation, only an implementation change.
