## Summary

This PIP proposes a backwards compatible addressing scheme to facilitate Layer-2 addresses as well as improve current Layer-1 payments and general usage.

## Motivation

PascalCoin current allows users to send/receive operations between accounts using their account numbers (PASA) as a reference. These account numbers are typically post-fixed with a checksum to avoid data entry errors. 

This proposal extends this specification to allow the embedding of a payload to an address. This allows a recipient to specify the payload the sender must enter when sending an operation. This is useful in many current use-cases such as a merchant specifying the payload code in the buyers transaction so that he can recognize it. Also, for exchanges to specify the payload for users to deposit. By using these addresses, a single PASA can be represented in many forms. 

Most importantly, Layer-2 applications require this as an addressing scheme for Layer-2 applications. As a result, this PIP proposes a formal specification for these addresses.

## Specification

Layer-2 addresses will be herein referred to as Extended PASA, or E-PASA for short.

### Extended PASA format (E-PASA)

An Extended PASA is defined by the below EBNF grammar:

    EPASA              = PASA, [ ExtendedAddress ] ;
    PASA               = Integer, "-", Checksum ;
    Checksum           = Digit, Digit ;
    ExtendedAddress    = ( PublicPayload | ReceiverEncPayload | SenderEncPayload | PasswordEncPayload ), [ ":", PayloadChecksum ] ;
    PublicPayload      = "[", Payload, "]" ;
    ReceiverEncPayload = "(", Payload, ")" ;
    SenderEncPayload   = "{", Payload, "}" ;
    PasswordEncPayload = "<", Payload, ":", Password, ">" ;
    Payload            = [ Pascal64String | HexString | Base58String ] ;      (* allows empty payload *)
    PayloadChecksum    = HexDigit, HexDigit, HexDigit, HexDigit
    Password           = HexString                                             (* force passwords to be specified in hex *)
    Pascal64String     = Pascal64StartChar, { Pascal64Char } ;
    Pascal64StartChar  ??= TODO
    Pascal64Char       ??= TODO
    HexString          = "0", "x", HexByte { HexByte } ;
    HexByte            = HexDigit, HexDigit
    HexDigit           = ( Digit | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" ) ;       (* no uppercase hex allowed *)
    Base58String       = Base58Char, { Base58Char } ;
    Base58Char         = ( NaturalDigit | Base58UpperChar | Base58LowerChar ) ; 
    Base58UpperChar    = ( "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N", "P", "Q", "R", "S", "T", "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y", "Z" ) ;     (* missing I, O *)
    Base58LowerChar    = ( "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z" ) ; (* missing l *)
    Digit              = ( "0" | NaturalDigit ) ;
    NaturalDigit       = ( "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ) ;


| Rule               | Explanation                                                                                                   |
| -----------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| EPASA              | This is a layer-2 address, fully backwards compatible as Layer-1 address                                      |
| PASA               | This is the standard layer-1 address of the receiver account                                                  |
| Checksum           | This is the standard layer-1 address checksum                                                                 |
| ExtendedAddress    | The optional extra text that forms part of layer-2 address (payload specification)                            |
| PublicPayload      | A payload which is not encrypted and publically visible                                                       |
| ReceiverEncPayload | A payload which is ICIES encrypted using receivers public key (the PASA portion specifies receiver)           |
| SenderEncPayload   | A payload which is ICIES encrypted using the senders public key (only sender can decrypt EPASA)               |
| PasswordEncPayload | A payload which is AES256 encrypted using the specified password                                              |
| Payload            | The actual payload data, specified it an well-defined encoding                                                |
| PayloadChecksum    | An UINT16 specified by two hexbytes (4 hexdigits) that denotes a checksum of payload, used to ensure payload consistency (prevents typo/copy-paste errors)  |
| Password           | The password used in PasswordEndPayload. Must be specified as a hexadecimal string                            |
| Pascal64String     | A Pascal64-encoded string. This encoding also used for specifying Account Names.                              |
| Base58String       | A Base58-encoded string. This is used for specifying public keys, and hashes of public keys                   |
| HexString          | A hexadecimal-encoded string prefixed with a 0x. Every byte specified by two hexdigits, lower-case            |

#### Payload Checksumming

In order to avoid data entry errors, the payload portion is **optionally** checksummed. The payload checksum is calculated as follows:

```
    PayloadChecksum = ToHexString ( CastToUINT16( MurMur3( PayloadEncType ++ Payload ) MOD 65536 ) )

    PayloadEncType  = "0" for PublicPayload
                    = "1" for ReceiverEncPayload
                    = "2" for SenderEncPayload
                    = "3" for PasswordEncPayload
       
```

The MurMur3 used here is the 32bit version. The hash digest is **Payload** portion of the E-PASA in it's ASCII form, not it's binary form. The Checksum will always be 4 hexadecimal digits and numerically ranged to 0 - 65535.

## Examples

### Example 1 

```
123456-77[0x12ab3f]:10cb 
```

- Receiver address is '123456-77'
- Payload is the hexadecimal string 0x12ab3f
- Payload is public (not encrypted)
- Payload checksum is 10cb

**Note**
 - To encrypt using senders key, address would be ```123456-77{0x12ab3f}:19de```.
 - To encrypt using recipients key, address would be ```123456-77(0x12ab3f):bf91```.
 - To encrypt using password "Alpha$", address would be ```123456-77<0x12ab3f:0x416c70686124>:dd32``` noting password converted into hex encoding.

 

### Example 2: 

```
77-44["herman@email.com"]:1234 
```

- Recipient address is '77-44'
- Payload is the Pascal64 string "herman@email.com"
- Payload is not encrypted (public)
- Payload checksum is "1234"

**NOTE**
- By using recipients key, ```77-44("herman@email.com"):5bd8``` exchanges could use such addresses to accept users deposits easily, via a single address per user.

## Rationale

The design approach was to remain backwards compatible in order to allow existing JSON API's to simply accept E-PASA addresses and which automatically fill out the payload fields.

## Backwards Compatibility

This PIP is backwards compatible and does not require a hard-fork activation, only an implementation change.
