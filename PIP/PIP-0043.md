## Summary

Update current OP_RECOVER operation in order to have a similar sense as described on [Original PascalCoin WhitePaper published on July 2016][1] few weeks before Genesis Block and also a community poll made on discord channel 

## Motivation

OP_RECOVER feature was defined on original PascalCoin Whitepaper published on July 2016 as a way to allow recover coins that has lost private key. 

**PascalCoin WhitePaper:** 
```
PascalCoin proposes an alternative to the basic operation of Bitcoin, through which change
several aspects for working on the new virtual currency:
...
  - PascalCoin provides a method set by protocol to retrieve coins that are not used
    instead (lost key). This method only applies if after a certain time the owner does not
    make any operation with the account private key.
...
(Page 2/8)
```

Basically was a way to mantain a constant and predectible usage of inflation and available coin because burning coins are not possible. 

Current problem is that WhitePaper definition is ambiguous and **certain time** was not specified, initial source code proposal was to **set a time value = 4 years** (420480 blocks in PascalCoin) 

Another problem is that WhitePaper was mixing coins (**PASC**) and accounts (**PASA**), because what is necessary in PascalCoin is an Account (aka PASA), so we can focus on recover PASA instead of recover coins inside PASA

## Proposal

This PIP specifies a more accurated OP_RECOVER that was discussed on Discord Channel
